** Rules and guidelines to work with Spring Container.

* Spring Container *
====================

1. Find/Scan classes (Spring Bean)
2. Create objects
3. Link objects (Inject / HAS-A)
4. Destroy the objects (even container)


** Container : Memory that holds objects.

==> Spring Container takes 2 inputs :-

1. Spring Bean : It is a class that follows rules given by Spring container.

2. Spring Configuration File : It gives metadata (obj name, link details, some data) This
   we can provide in 3 ways :- XML config, Java config, Annotation config**


==> There are two types of Containers given by Spring f/w.

1.  BeanFactory(I) : It supports only XML Config. It has one Impl class.
    Ex. :- XmlBeanFactory(C).
    It is also called as legacy container.

2.  ApplicationContext(I) : It supports all configuration (XML/Java/Annotation). 
    It has multiple impl classes.
Ex. :-  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(C)
        FileSystemXmlApplicationContext(C)
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(C)
