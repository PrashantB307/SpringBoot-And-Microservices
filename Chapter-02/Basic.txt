<====  Spring Framework  ====> 
==============================

=> To develop web based applications.

Framework = Technologies + Design Patterns
RAD = Rapid Application Development.
Less Error rate.
Boiler plate Code (Reduce duplicate code).

Ex :- Shopping App
Servlets, JSP, JDBC = 20K LOC  (LOC = Lines of Code)
Spring Framework = 10K LOC


<====  Spring Boot  ====> 
=========================

==> Autoconfiguration, that comes with pre-defined spring code which reduces LOC. 
    (Common lines of Code).

=> There is parent project created by Pivotal Team. 
=> That gives some common code in pre-defined format (JARS)
=> Your project should extend parent project.
=> Project can be created either using Maven/Gradle
=> Embedded Servers (Tomcat/ Jetty/ Undertow) and databases (H2/ HSQL/ Derby) 
    are given in Spring boot.


<====  Microservices  ====>
===========================

It is a design to develop a very big app.

(Spring Cloud) --- Design of writing an application.
AWS Cloud -- To run your application.
Develop -- Build -- Deployment    

=> Monolithic Application :- Developing application and build as a single unit.
    All Modules code as a single file.

=> Limitation :-
 
* If one module code is modified, entire app need to be rebuild and re-deploy
* If one module is not working properly that may effect other modules too.


Microservices : It is a design to develop a very big app.
===============

=> One Module is converted into One Application 
=> Parallel Development, Deployment, Moniter, AutoScale (Load Balance).

Spring Cloud : It is a API used to develop apps using microservices design.
